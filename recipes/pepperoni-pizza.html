        <h4>Pizza Crust Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>3¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 (0.25 ounce) pizza crut yeast</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                <li>1½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1⅓ cups very warm water</li>
                <li>⅓ cup oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Toppings</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>6 ounce pepperoni</li>
                <li>1 cup mozzarella cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste.</li>
                <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
                <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed.</li>
                <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
                <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
